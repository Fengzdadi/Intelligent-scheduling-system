## Introduction

This is a intelligent scheduling system, which can help you, as the manager, to manage the work scheduling in you
company.

For most people, this should be a back-end demo. You can learn the basic file structure of the
back-end, [the gin framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin), the way to write the add-delete database, and the way
to call the algorithm from here.

For subsequent needs, you can contact the author to open the source code of the front-end.

## Features

- **Easy to use:** you can use it easily, just input, and get the result.
- **Fast:** it can help you to get the result in a short time. Because we use efficient algorithms and programming
  languages(C++).
- **Accurate:** it can help you to get the result in a high accuracy.
- **Multi-selectivity of results:** We can present different results for you to choose from.
- **High degree of customization:** There is a wealth of typographic rules for you to choose from
